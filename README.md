# Global Cyber Security Analysis

## Project Overview

1. This project performs exploratory data analysis on global cybersecurity indices to evaluate cybersecurity readiness and digital development across countries.

2. The analysis compares:

       Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)

       Cybersecurity Effectiveness Index (CEI)

       National Cybersecurity Index (NSCI)

       Digital Development Level (DDL)

## Tools Used

    Python (Pandas, NumPy)

    Jupyter Notebook

    Tableau

    Dataset Source: Kaggle

## Key Visualizations

     Country-level filled map

     Comparative bar charts (GCI, CEI, NSCI)

     Scatter plot (DDL vs CEI)

     Correlation heatmap

     Summary comparison table

## Key Insights

    Countries with higher digital development tend to show stronger cybersecurity readiness.

    Significant regional disparities exist.

    High digital maturity does not always guarantee strong cybersecurity implementation.

    Policy alignment is critical for improving national cyber readiness.
